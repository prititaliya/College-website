        <p>
        In the new environment of liberalization, the field of technical education have been facing the challenges not only from inside but also from the outside world. It has changed the role of teachers, administrators, and planners involved in the field of technical education. The barrier between a classroom and an industry, anywhere in the world, is now very transparent with respect to technology. The large number of national & international technical institutes, who are wrestling to employee their students, are in search of innovative teaching methods. Our institute, which is the oldest in South Gujarat region, is committed to provide quality education, to produce young entrepreneurs, and to involve themselves for the benefits of all stakeholders.<br>
